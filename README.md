## Overview
**Fitman™** is a side-scroller runner game created using the Arduino UNO R4 and a 16x2 LCD. The player is controlled using AI that interprets body poses — jumping when the player stands and running while crouched. It combines embedded electronics, custom LCD graphics, and machine learning for human interaction.

## Game Mechanics

- **Display:** LCD shows terrain on top/bottom row.
- **Character Movement:** Auto-run, jump on player input.
- **Score:** Distance counter increases over time.
- **Collision Detection:** Game ends if player hits obstacle.

### Graphics
- Custom sprite blocks for:
  - `run1`, `run2`
  - `jump` (upper/lower)
  - `solid terrain`, `edge blocks`
- Sprites are drawn using CGRAM on the LCD.

### Game Loop
- Move terrain each cycle
- Animate run/jump sprites
- Update screen + score
- Detect and respond to collisions

### Input Handling
- **Standing Pose:** AI sends `jump` signal to Arduino
- **Crouching Pose:** Character continues running

## Challenges Faced

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| LCD wouldn’t display with 220Ω resistor | Switched to RW pin fix (no resistor) |
| AI input lag | Switched from `if()` to `while()` for faster updates |
| Integration of Teachable Machine to Arduino | Required manual input parsing and timing control |

## Improvements & Next Steps
- 3D-printed parts for neat assembly
- Smooth animation handling
- More stable, readable game logic
- High score saving logic (EEPROM)
- Add difficulty levels & power-ups
